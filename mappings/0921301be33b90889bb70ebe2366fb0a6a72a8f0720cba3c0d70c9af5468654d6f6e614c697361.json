        "value": "This is the FIRST TRUE NFT of the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci on the Cardano Blockchain. I flew to France just two weeks ago, & I literally took this picture in the Louvre with my own high-end camera  (as opposed to just copy/pasting a picture from somewhere else online). That gives me exclusive rights to sell this image/NFT, and once sold, the buyer will OWN the EXCLUSIVE rights to the first TRUE NFT of the world's most prolific piece of artwork on the Cardano Blockchain. This is a 1 of 1."
